<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This creamy pasta recipe is an absolute must make dinner!  Whenever we go to the Cheesecake Factory there are a few dishes we just can’t pass up. We always get the Avocado Egg Rolls and this Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta. Since we can’t go to the Cheesecake Factory every night, I wanted to be able to bring a little bit of the Cheesecake Factory to the house with this pasta recipe!</p>

<p>We just love making this simple chipotle pasta recipe because it’s a quick dinner recipe you can make any night of the week. Just over 30 minutes is all it takes to make this creamy dish. I also love how it is a complete meal all on it’s own. This creamy pasta is packed with carbs, protein, and vegetables making it the perfect all in one dinner!</p>
